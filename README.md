# Download and Delete Twitch Clips

Important, need to get your twitch token via inspector due to using gql.  You can get a token by going to twitch in chrome.
While logged in press f12. Go to the **console** tab, and at the cursor type in:

**cookies["auth-token"]**

***AUTH TOKENS ARE LIKE PASSWORDS DO NOT POST ANYWHERE***

This will give you the token. Refer to the image below:

## Experimental version features
### Experimental version here:

#### 0.5
http://danefairbanks.com/downloads/apps/ClipManager.0.5.zip

Removed my clips/channel clips ability in favor of stability.  Can do upper and lower limits bounds for view count at the same time.  Will process by date allowing better resume functionality.  A lot more stable, but limitation on missing the least amount of viewed clips over 1000 in a time frame.  If you have close to 1000 average clips a day set Day Interval to 1, if you average less than a 1000 clips a week set Day Interval to 7 you can set it any value between up to your own personal averages.

#### 0.2
http://danefairbanks.com/downloads/apps/ClipManager.0.2.zip

Can start processing from a low to high view count.
Can Limit what view count you process.
Limit is dependent on sort order.

On a sort of low to high, limit will be the upper bound.
On a sort of high to low, limit will be the lower bound.

This version batches around 1000 clips (twitch limitation).  Unfortunately if you don't enable deleting processing will be limited to 1000 clips.  I 900 or more clips are processed and delete option is on it will run the processing again.

Common use case: Delete clips with low view count
Enable deleting, choose low to high option, set limit to 1000.  
App will delete every clip with less than 1000 views.

Common use case: Download all cliips with high view count
Enable download, choose high to low option, set limit to 1000.
App will download every clip with more than 1000 views.
